            I&apos;ve genuinely enjoyed every job I&apos;ve had, but nothing
            compares to the love I have for working with code. My absolute
            favorite part is fixing problematic code, I have learned the most
            during times when I am stuck and need to dive deep into research to
            figure out a solution. I do not have a ton of experience yet, but
            I’m a fast learner and can learn anything put in front of me. I’m
            adaptable, reliable, and easy to work with.
